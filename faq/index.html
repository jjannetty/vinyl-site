            <h2>What is 'formation stage'?</h2>
            <p>Vinyl prefers to stake founders as they are forming the business. Pre-revenue, pre-product and in many cases pre-DBA.</p>
          </div>
        
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h2>What is Vinyl known for?</h2>

              CPG lab testing infrastructure, AI travel solutions, excess inventory management, manufacturing quality assurance, 
              loyalty platforms, warehouse automation, and search/personalization optimization.

            <h2>Who can confirm Vinyl is good at commerce infrastructure?</h2>
            <p>Vinyl's founders, non-portfolio founders and co-investors… their words, not ours.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “TJ is the kind of person founders want to work with, in part because he's a founder himself. 
                He's easily been one of our most helpful investors in building Klaviyo.”<br>
                <strong>- Andrew Bialecki, CEO & Co-Founder, Klaviyo</strong>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “I would argue Vinyl is the most savvy and connected investor pursuing opportunities around commerce enablement.”<br>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                “It's not close. We had a lot of options during our first raise and Vinyl was clearly the strongest in category. 
                Easiest decision I've had to make.”<br>

            <h2>What does Vinyl NOT invest in?</h2>
            <p>Vinyl does not invest in physical consumer/brand products. Retailers and brands are often the customers of our companies.</p>

            <h2>Why did you name the firm 'Vinyl'?</h2>
            <p>
              The first secure online purchase (1994) was a Sting album — music started the digital overhaul of commerce.
